<h1>URDF2RobOptim Report</h1>

<p>This is an automatic generated HTML file by the URDF2optcontrol tool.</p>

<h2>Settings of the problem</h2>

<p>In the following doc you will be able to analyze the cost function, the joint trajectories and the custom constraints you gave to the problem.</p>

<h2>Cost function</h2>

<p>In pink you can see the final term cost, if given. This graph should help you balance the cost function and the final term.</p>

{{ my_figure2 }}

<h2>Joints Behaviour</h2>

<p>Here below you can see the joint dynamics and the input trajectories.
Red boundaries (if any) are the ones the limits written in the URDF, if you gave some additional custom constraints, it won't appear here.</p>

{{ my_figure1 }}


<h2>Constraints</h2>

<p>Here you have the constraints you gave, on the same order, and you can see if they had been respected.</p>
